  How this Project Deploys & runs locally
  The CSPROJ has post build steps to create the runtime folder structure
  1. Target Folder is created for this environment in SangamRT
  2. Config files (customer, environment, feeds, schedule and alerts) are copied to the target 
  3. The package containing jobs, workflows etc. is extracted at the target
  4. Sangam Single Box is launched with this folder as the root
